            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young explorer named Leo set off on a journey to find the hidden treasure of the ancient kingdom. Armed with nothing but a map and his wits, Leo ventured into the dense jungle, where he faced many dangers.</p>
            <p>He crossed raging rivers, climbed steep cliffs, and battled fierce animals. After days of travel, Leo arrived at the entrance to the lost temple. Inside, he faced a series of puzzles and traps, but his cleverness and courage led him to the treasure room.</p>
            <p>There, in the heart of the temple, lay a chest filled with gold coins and precious jewels. Leo knew that the real treasure, however, was the journey and the lessons he had learned along the way.</p>
